    <h1>
        ALL <br />
        THAT <br />JAZZ
    </h1>
    <h2>
        A homage to the musicians that <br />learnt all the rules of music,
        <br />and then <em>broke</em> them to create <br /><strong>
            <em>magic</em></strong>.
    </h2>
    <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
    <p>
        Jazz, the heartbeat of cool, syncopates through the soul of music, defying
        rules and dancing on the edges of spontaneity. It's the language of the
        night, whispered in the smoky haze of dim-lit clubs and echoed in the
        vibrant streets of New Orleans. In this eclectic rhythm playground, the
        legends emerge: <strong>Miles Davis</strong>, the trumpet sorcerer, paints
        sonic landscapes, while <strong>Duke Ellington </strong>orchestrates
        dreams with piano keys. <br /><br />Jazz is more than a genre; it's the
        <em>art of improvisation</em>, where each note is a rebellion, and every
        musician becomes a poet of the unpredictable, crafting melodies that echo
        the heartbeat of freedom.

    <div class="infoAlbum">
        <em>'Kind of Blue'</em> is regarded as one of the best jazz albums
        recorded in history, and its magical 5 tracks of modal harmonies achieved
        what many other jazz albums couldn't: transforming the mainstream public
        into jazz enthusiasts. Six of the best jazz musicians of all time took
        part on this album: Saxophonists John Coltrane and Julian "Cannonball"
        Adderley, pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy
        Cobb, with Miles Davis leading the sextet. <br /><br />
        Whilst the whole album serves today as the bible for all aspiring jazz
        musicians and piano players (myself included),
        <em>'Flamenco Sketches'</em> is my all time favourite: Its soft rhythm and
        melody, together with its melancholic atmosphere and outstanding solos and
        harmonic changes never fail to uplift my spirits and fill me with
        inspiration. <br /><br />
